	JOINS: 
	
	CREATING ANOTHER TABLE
	
	MARKS

	ALTER TABLE MARKS

	INSERT INTO MARKS(SNO, ROLL, NAME, DSA, ENG, MAT)
VALUES

	JOINS: WHEN WE WANT TO GET DATA FROM 2 DIFFERENT TABLE
	CROSS JOINS:
		IT RETURNS THE CROSS PRODUCT OF 

	THINGS I LEARNED TODAY:

	1. YOU CANNOT DELETE A COLUMN WHICH CONTAINS ANY CONSTRAINTS.

	2. TO COL WITH CONSTRAINT WE NEED TO DELETE THE CONSTRAINT FIRST
	AND ONLY THEN WE CAN DELETE THE COLUMN;

	3. COMMAND TO DELETE PHY COLUMN FROM MARKS IS
	ALTER TABLE MARKS
	DROP COLUMN PHY;

	4. JOINS
		4.1 CROSS JOINS: EVERY ROW IN T1 IS CROSSED WITH EVERY ROW IN T2;
		4.2 INNER JOINS/ JOINS: ONLY ROWS WHERE THE 'ON' CONDITION IS MATCHED ARE RETURNED
		4.3 LEFT JOIN: BASICALLY INNER JOIN + ROWS FROM T1 WHERE CONDITION DIDN'T MATCH
		4.4 RIGHT JOIN: INNER JOIN + ROWS FROM T2 WHERE CONDITION DIDN'T MATCH

	5. UPDATE, ALTER TABLE, ADD
